       <h2>CALLIGRAPHY</h2>
       <br>
      <p>It's a bit similar to lettering, but not in everything. It is more like the design and execution of lettering.The easiest way to know the difference between lettering and calligraphy is that lettering are drawn letters and calligraphy are written and require ornaments.As long as you have free time, practice the letters that you like the most and you will see that they become a super fun habit.The first letters or words never look good or "perfect", do not feel bad, keep trying new things. You have to create with what you have in front of you and make this part of your daily habit</p>
